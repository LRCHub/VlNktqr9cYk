[00:00.00] Hey, I thought it was all over
[00:04.51] What's up, Doechii?
[00:05.32] Hey, girl
[00:06.21] You know it's been a lil' minute since you and I have had a chat
[00:09.38] Has it really?
[00:10.24] Probably since, like, your last EP, Oh The Places You'll Go
[00:13.25] Oh, wow, it's been a minute (Yeah)
[00:14.89] I've been gettin' some calls
[00:15.94] Oh?
[00:16.67] People are a little bit worried about you
[00:17.64] Not worried, okay
[00:18.49] And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so
[00:20.35] You were
[00:20.71] Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on?
[00:23.13] Okay
[00:25.13] 
[00:23.81] Remember old dude from 2019, nice clean nigga
[00:27.12] Did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
[00:29.23] Took a scroll through his IG
[00:30.96] Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
[00:34.29] I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
[00:36.44] She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
[00:39.00] I open up the messages then had to hit the zoom
[00:41.73] Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
[00:44.55] Nigga think he slicked back till I slipped back
[00:46.81] Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
[00:49.54] I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
[00:51.49] And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021
[01:13.99] 
[00:54.79] Okay, I just feel like this is the perfect opportunity for us to just
[00:58.33] Take a second and kind off unpack what's happened to you
[01:01.06] You know, this guy cheated on you and—
[01:03.23] Mm, nah, fuck it
[01:03.83] Ow
[01:04.83] 
[01:05.24] "Platinum" record this, viral record that
[01:07.37] I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
[01:09.68] I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
[01:12.44] And no, I'm not in a gang but I'm always on set
[01:14.93] Wrist watch, drip drop, labels want the TikToks
[01:17.77] Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what the fuck?
[01:20.40] I need cleanse, need a detox
[01:22.45] But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
[01:25.61] Fast forward, me 2023
[01:28.15] I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
[01:30.50] My grass is really green, and
[01:45.00] 
[01:32.35] Honestly, I can't even fucking cap
[01:33.95] This is a really dark time for me
[01:35.45] I'm goin' through a lot
[01:36.51] By a lot, you mean drugs?
[01:37.62] Um, I wouldn't—
[01:38.52] Drugs?
[01:39.27] No, it's a—
[01:40.17] No?
[01:40.57] It's a natural plant
[01:41.21] No, I'm not judging
[01:42.32] I'm not an addict
[01:42.87] I'm just sayin'
[01:43.89] I don't think—
[01:44.65] You wanna talk about it?
[01:45.37] Uh
[01:46.37] 
[01:46.34] I mean fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
[01:48.77] I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
[01:51.23] I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
[01:53.77] I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it, probably would
[01:56.60] What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
[01:59.19] And my self-worth's at an all time low
[02:01.53] And just when it couldn't get worse
[02:03.39] My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
[02:07.39] Whoopsie, made a oopsie
[02:09.31] One-hundred thousand dollar "oops" made me loopy
[02:11.69] I ain't a killer but don't push me
[02:14.29] Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans
[02:40.79] 
[02:17.21] Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
[02:18.64] Rurr
[02:18.71] Okay, Doechii, we don't wanna revert back into our old ways
[02:20.70] Sorry, okay
[02:21.60] So, we're gonna try a breathin' exercise, okay?
[02:23.65] Alright, word
[02:24.26] When I breathe, you breathe
[02:25.38] Okay
[02:25.83] Alright? Let's go
[02:27.37] Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[02:36.90] Woosah
