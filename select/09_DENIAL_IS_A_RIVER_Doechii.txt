Hey, I thought it was all over
What's up, Doechii?
Hey, girl
You know it's been a lil' minute since you and I have had a chat
Has it really?
Probably since, like, your last EP, Oh The Places You'll Go
Oh, wow, it's been a minute (Yeah)
I've been gettin' some calls
Oh?
People are a little bit worried about you
Not worried, okay
And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so
You were
Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on?
Okay

Remember old dude from 2019, nice clean nigga
Did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages then had to hit the zoom
Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
Nigga think he slicked back till I slipped back
Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021

Okay, I just feel like this is the perfect opportunity for us to just
Take a second and kind off unpack what's happened to you
You know, this guy cheated on you and—
Mm, nah, fuck it
Ow

"Platinum" record this, viral record that
I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
And no, I'm not in a gang but I'm always on set
Wrist watch, drip drop, labels want the TikToks
Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what the fuck?
I need cleanse, need a detox
But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
Fast forward, me 2023
I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
My grass is really green, and

Honestly, I can't even fucking cap
This is a really dark time for me
I'm goin' through a lot
By a lot, you mean drugs?
Um, I wouldn't—
Drugs?
No, it's a—
No?
It's a natural plant
No, I'm not judging
I'm not an addict
I'm just sayin'
I don't think—
You wanna talk about it?
Uh

I mean fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it, probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all time low
And just when it couldn't get worse
My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
Whoopsie, made a oopsie
One-hundred thousand dollar "oops" made me loopy
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Rurr
Okay, Doechii, we don't wanna revert back into our old ways
Sorry, okay
So, we're gonna try a breathin' exercise, okay?
Alright, word
When I breathe, you breathe
Okay
Alright? Let's go
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Woosah
